# Deep Learning Assignments

## Overview
This repositary contains the practice of deep learning assignments from scratch that for gain the knowledge of neaural networks and machine learning use in real word problems.

## Problem Statements
For all the assignments problem statements given in this pdf file [Deep Learning Assignments](https://github.com/koladiyadhruvin/Deep-Learning-Assignments/blob/main/Deep%20Learning%20Assignments.pdf)
